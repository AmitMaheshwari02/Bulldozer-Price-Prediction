# Bulldozer Price Prediction

This project leverages machine learning to predict the sale prices of bulldozers. The analysis and modeling are documented in the provided Jupyter Notebook, `bulldozer-price-prediction.ipynb`.

## Overview
The project uses historical auction data to predict the price of bulldozers sold at auction. By analyzing key features, such as equipment age, usage, and auctioneer information, the model aims to provide accurate price predictions to assist businesses and individuals in making informed decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about bulldozer sales, including:
- Sale date
- Machine model and type
- Equipment age
- Auctioneer details
- Usage metrics (if available)

### Source
The dataset is derived from the [Kaggle Bulldozer Price Prediction Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers).

## Tools and Libraries
The following tools and libraries were used in this project:
- **Python**
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning modeling

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Investigates dataset structure, identifies missing values, and performs feature engineering.
  - Visualizes key relationships in the data.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Handles missing data.
  - Extracts useful features like year of sale, month of sale, and equipment age.

- **Modeling:**
  - Implements regression models to predict prices.
  - Uses techniques like Random Forest for enhanced accuracy.

- **Evaluation:**
  - Evaluates models using metrics such as the Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmitMaheshwari02/Bulldozer-Price-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook `bulldozer-price-prediction.ipynb`.
   ```bash
   cd Bulldozer-Price-Prediction
   jupyter notebook bulldozer-price-prediction.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells step-by-step to explore the analysis and replicate the model predictions.

## Results
The model achieves a competitive Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by leveraging relevant features and a robust regression algorithm. Full results and insights are documented in the notebook.

## Future Work
- Experiment with additional advanced models like Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost or LightGBM).
- Enhance feature engineering to capture more domain-specific insights.
- Incorporate external datasets to improve predictive power.
